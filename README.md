# FilmPhotography
The theme of this project is film photography, covering every aspect of the craft, including equipment, film stocks, light metering, development, aesthetics, and film simulation. It primarily documents my personal feelings and experiences gained through practice, reading, and exchanges related to film photography.
## File Management
### main_notes
A folder named **main_notes** will store core notes, including  files in formats such as .pdf,  .tex, .png, .jpg, ect. The images involved will be divided into two categories: one type serves explanatoory or illustrative purposes and will be placed in the subfolder named **figures**; the other consists of photographs taken, which will be stored in separate folders.
### photos
A folder named **photos** will store photographs, organized into subfolders--one for each fill roll--all manually developed and photographed by myself. The folders will be named in the format: Date + Film Model + Location.
